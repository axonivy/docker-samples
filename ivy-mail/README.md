# Mail

There are different reasons why an Axon Ivy Engine sends mail:

- New-Task and Daily-Task Summary Mails to your users
- License Violation Mails to the admin users
- Mail Acitivties in your business processes

You need to configure an Mail Server so that the Axon Ivy Engine
can send mails (ivy.yaml).

In this example we also have customized the new task and daily task
mail with custom mail processes.

Start a process of an Axon Ivy Engine and open http://localhost:3000
to see all Mails which has the Axon Ivy Engine sent.
