# Mail

To notify users the Axon Ivy Engine will send mails for
example for new task assignments.

You need to configure an Mail Server so that the Axon Ivy Engine
can send mails (ivy.yaml).

In this example we also have customized the new task and daily task
mail with custom mail processes.

Start a process of an Axon Ivy Engine and open http://localhost:3000
to see all Mails which has the Axon Ivy Engine sent.
