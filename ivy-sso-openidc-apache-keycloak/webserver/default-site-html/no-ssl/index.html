		Demo Webserver Home
	</h1>

	<p>
		Your webserver is working. However, most of the stuff is configured to work with SSL and Authentication only.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The test users are working for SAML as well as OAuth/OIDC, as it comes from same ID-Provider Server.
		<ul>
			<li>user "admin" and password "admin"</li>
			<li>user "demo" and password "demo"</li>
		</ul>

		You can find <a href="https://localhost:8443/">JBoss Keycloak</a> IDP here. Login to admin panel with user "admin" and password "admin".
	</p>


	<h2>
		OAuth/OIDC Examples (working on HTTPS with default port)
	</h2>
	<p>
		Please change to <a href="https://localhost">https://localhost</a>
	</p>


	<h2>
		No SSL and no auth
	</h2>
	<p>
		You can test forwarding to <a href="/ivy/">Axon.ivy Engine</a> without any security here.
