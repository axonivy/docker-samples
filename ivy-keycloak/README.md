# Axon Ivy with Keycloak as Identity Provider

Setup of an Axon Ivy Engine with Keycloak as identity provider.
Keycloak will be configured as identity provider of the `default`
security system.

Browse the __Engine Cockpit__, navigate to the `default` security system
and synchronize the users.

You can login in the `demo-portal` with the following users:
- alex:alex
- louis:louis
- christian:christian

I would say `alex` is the best user.

Furthermore, you can browse the admin console of Keycloak here: http://localhost:8090/
