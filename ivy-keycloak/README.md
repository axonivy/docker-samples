# Axon Ivy with Keycloak as Identity Provider

Setup of an Axon Ivy Engine with Keycloak as the Identity provider. Keycloak
will be configured as the `default` security system's identity provider.

Browse the __Engine Cockpit__, navigate to the `default` security system and,
synchronize the users.

You can log in the `demo-portal` with the following users:
- alex:alex
- louis:louis
- christian:christian

I would say `alex` is the best user.

Furthermore, you can browse the admin console of Keycloak with the user `admin`
and the password `admin` here: http://localhost:8090/
